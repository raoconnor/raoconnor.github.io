Tech head, VMUG Leader, vExpert, VMware, Azure and AWS Architect 
A native Englishman living in Barcelona, I love learning and listening to smart people. 

This blog replaces my much neglected wordpress blog on raoconnor.com and is dedicated to passing along some thoughts on cloud, VMware, architecture, infrastructure costs and strategy, personal and professional development.
