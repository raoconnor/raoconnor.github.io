# NSX-T Homelab

Setting up a homelab to run NSX-T is probably not the best place to start if you are just rebuilding a homelab after a couple of years of hiatus in the cloud.

### Basic requirements
dns, shared storage, vCenter, ESX cluster of two or three hosts, lots of RAM (12 GB for the VCSA, 16 GB for a single NSX-T Manager, and 4GB each for the two edge nodes) and sufficient CPU.

### Hardware
In my case I had a Intel NUC8BEB with a i5-8259U CPU which gives me up to 3.80 Ghz and 64 GB of RAM and a Maxtang NX6412 with a Celeron J6412 which provides 2.60GHZ and 32GB of RAM. 

I use the NUC as my home PC, it has windows 11 installed and after having some issue with installing ESXi 7 on the Maxtang of decided to go down the VMware workstation route for both systems.

### Issues with network design
And while I got it to work, I had a lot of intermittent network errors, especially routing over the backbone between the two boxes with workstation virtual networks, changes to the network required vms to be rebooted, pfsense firewalls and routing was taking a lot of my time.

### Revised network with physical router and switch
I replaced the two pfsense virtual routers/firewalls with a physial router and switch, the router can do single vlans, but so far I vlan trunking doesn't work, I suspect the downstream workstation virtual network (I can use pfsense for a host only vlan trunk if needed).

Jumbo frames are limited to the switch, the router doesn't have that capacity.
***As a learning point***, use a small footprint linux (photon OS in my case) to check the networks/ vlans and jumbo frames at each step, photon requires some work on setting up a static ip and installing iputils and ping 

### More CPU please
As you can see I was running vcsa and nsxt manager on the NUC and the edge cluster on the Maxtang, and needed more than the 6.40GHz of CPU those two processors provided, maybe directly on ESXi this would be enough

```
NUC 
nested host1    4 vcpus, 24 GB ram
nested host2    4 vcpus, 24 GB ram
dns vm          2 vcpus, 4 GB ram
nfs vm          2 vcpus, 4 GB ram
vcsa (host1)    2 vcpus, 12 GB ram   
msx mgr (host2) 2 vcpus, 12 GB ram   

Maxtang
nested host2   4 vcpus, 16 GB ram
nested host2   4 vcpus, 16 GB ram
edge1 (host6)  2 vcpus, 4 GB ram  
edge2 (host7)  2 vcpus, 4 GB ram  

Note: edge cluster nodes need 16GB Mem to run the transport zone
```
### Conclusion 
I was only able to get as far as setting up transport zones, segments and trying to deploy the edge nodes. Still I was a good experience and I enjoyed getting my hands on NSX again as itâ€™s been a while and products change.
