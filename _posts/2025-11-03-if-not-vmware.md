If Not VMware, Then Where?
VMware no longer holds a monopoly on virtualization; there are other strong options

Public Cloud
One company’s loss is another’s gain. Cloud providers are actively capitalizing on the situation by offering funding and credits to offset migration costs. That’s attractive to budget-conscious customers and helps build goodwill.
However, the desire to make the cloud case work can lead to overly optimistic TCO calculations. Sentiment plays a role here too—when your boss expresses a strong desire to “make this work,” you may need to shelve your bottom-up approach to calculating costs.
Understanding the agenda and motives of others is critical. Vendors want to sell; your boss needs to get the IT budget approved. That can result in strategically overlooking potential higher costs to get a solution approved. But that is not true for all organizations, maybe that want an honest, detailed evaluation, and in some cases public cloud, it may not be the best fit.admin


Staying On-Premises
When indicators suggest public cloud isn’t right for your organization, how do you decide whether to move on or stay? The cost equation seems simple:
Effort + migration cost < license increase
But this ignores intangibles such as sentiment.
In social media, sentiment is measured by analysing words or emojis to interpret attitudes toward a topic or brand. What I’m suggesting is a quantitative valuation of sentiment—based on measurable criteria.
Let’s start with why your organization is exiting VMware. It’s not a technical issue, but it will have financial implications, and it’s important to get it right.
I asked ChatGPT to create a vendor evaluation checklist, and it produced these categories and criteria
