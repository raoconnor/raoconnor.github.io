**Moving home is stressful.** From the moment you decide it’s time to find a new place, to exploring options within your budget, signing new contracts, and terminating old ones—it’s a lot. Then comes the physical effort of packing, the move itself, and finally adjusting to a new environment.

I attended Nutanix .Next 2025 recently, and it felt a bit like a homebuyers’ meetup. Many attendees had been running VMware environments for years. I think most would say that vSphere is the virtualization software they know and love.

But for many, a potential move was on the horizon. I joined several sessions focused on migration, and one thing stood out: Nutanix has developed some excellent tools to make the transition easier. This wasn’t just marketing spin—I heard it echoed in audience comments and hallway conversations. **Nutanix Move** consistently came up as a great user experience for VM migrations.

Of course, it doesn’t cover every scenario. In some cases, appliances are better off being redeployed, and databases might be better suited for Nutanix Database Service.

As a long-time vSphere admin, I cut my teeth on P2V conversions. More recently, I’ve been trying to move VMs to Oracle Cloud. The technical constraints—like size limits, the need to inject new drivers, and instances that simply won’t boot after migration—have cost me countless hours and a fair bit of frustration.

We recently moved my mom out of our family home of 40 years. It was traumatic for all of us. She didn’t really want to go, but it was the best option. So when a move is forced on you, anything that can reduce the stress and lower the effort is more than welcome
