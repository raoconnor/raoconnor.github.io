#### The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win
*Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford* 

Set in the form of a novel, I love this book because it's characters keep turning up in my life, especially the IT hero with superpowers who saves the enterprise during an outage, I've played that character and it’s a huge buzz to resuscitate a critical business service - but the enterprise needs engineering and not ego.

There is one passage that hat blew my mind, it discusses wait times and come up with the formula ( wait time = (% Busy)/(% Idle)), while based on software development, the principle holds true for most IT requests, so to improve lead time, we need to control/balance the amount of assigned tasks with the capacity (idle time) to process.

This isn`t a technology book, but it does cover the role habits play in organizations, social movements, and individuals.
