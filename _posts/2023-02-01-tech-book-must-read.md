#### The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win
Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford 

*Set in the form of a novel, I love this book because it's characters keep turning up in my life, especially the IT hero with superpowers who saves the enterprise during an outage, I've played that character and it’s a huge buzz to resuscitate a critical business service - but the enterprise needs engineering and not ego.*

*There is one passage that hat blew my mind, it discusses wait times and come up with the formula ( wait time = (% Busy)/(% Idle)), while based on software development, the principle holds true for most IT requests, so to improve lead time, we need to control/balance the amount of assigned tasks with the capacity (idle time) to process.*

####  The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations
Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford 

*The follow on to 'The Phoenix Project', it elaborates on the ‘three ways': **Flow, Feedback and Continuous Improvement**, and explains how lean Manufacturing principles apply to the technology value stream. There is so much in this book, I’m shocked so many who work in the industry have not read it.*

####  Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems
Niall Richard Murphy, Betsy Beyer, Chris Jones 

*This should be taught as a 101 for anyone entering the industry, how can anyone think they cannot learn from how Google build and operate their own systems. The only problem with reading this book is you are going to be frustrated the rest of your working life with those who don’t take an engineering mindset to running production systems at scale.*

*If you have read the three books already mentioned you already realize that people of one of the big problems in technology, escilaly refusal to change the way they have allways doen something. Hence this is a must read for IT managers and leaders who wnat to drive transformation. This isn`t a technology book, but it does cover the role habits play in organizations, social movements, and individuals.*
